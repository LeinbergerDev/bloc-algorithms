1) This code will run in constant time so the big-O is O(1)
2) This code runs in linear time.  The larger the dataset the more time the code will run for.  The big-o is O(n).
3) The code runs in linear time. the algorithm iterates over each item in the collection to find the largest value.
   the larger the value of n the longer it takes to run. The big-o is O(n).
4) This algorithm is recursive and has the big-O of O(n).
5) Since this algorithm counts back from n to zero it runs in linear time.  The big-o is O(n).
6) This code runs in Loglinear time.  The big-o is O(n log n).
