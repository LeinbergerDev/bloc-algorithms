Algorithm #2 : Driving to work.

while driving_to_work == true
    if door closed
        open door
    end
    sit in drivers seat
    put on seat belt
    start engine
    put car in driver
    pull out of the driveway
    turn right
    continue to first intersection
    enter left turn lane
    if light is green && lane is clear
        turn left
    else
        while light is red || lane is not clear
            stop vehicle
            if light is red
                wait for light to turn green
            else if lane is not clear
                wait for lane to clear
            end
        end
        turn left
    end
    continue 1.5 miles 
    if lane is clear
        turn left into parking lot

Algorithm #3 : Calculating a tip
if bill_recieved == true
    total = bill.total
    tip = total * 0.20
    return tip.round_up
end
